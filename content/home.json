  "aboutBody": "Hi! I am a Norfolk born and bred actor and actor-combatant now living it large in London. I knew I wanted to be an actor from the early age of five when I first stepped on to stage as a angel in the nativity, and it's been impossible to keep me from performing ever since! I am experienced in all sorts of performance styles including screen, stage, outdoor theatre, commercial, green screen and improvisation. I love stage combat, being highly skilled in numerous weapons - from broadsword to group unarmed to staff. I can also crack an 8ft bullwhip so am well placed to play Indiana Jones in the reboot! Alongside acting I love drawing and painting, and am currently delving into the world of digital art illustrating my second play at home escape room game. When not acting you can often find me out running, especially as I prepare to run my second marathon, or administering Covid Vaccines for the NHS and St Johns Ambulance. If you have a project you think I'd be right for please drop me a message, I promise I don't bite!",
